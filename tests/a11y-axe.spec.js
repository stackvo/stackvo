/**
 * Rules a machine can check, on components that are really mounted.
 *
 * `a11y.spec.js` beside this file greps the sources for icon buttons with no
 * accessible name. That is a good test and it is one rule, checked against
 * text. This one runs axe over the rendered DOM, so it covers the rules that
 * only exist once a component has rendered: roles that only make sense in the
 * tree they ended up in, form controls and their labels, ARIA attributes
 * pointing at ids that exist, and names on the elements a framework generates
 * rather than the author.
 *
 * It earned its place on the first run, which is the only endorsement worth
 * quoting: `StatCard`'s meter had `role="progressbar"` and `aria-valuenow` and
 * no name, so a dashboard of four of them announced four bare numbers to a
 * screen reader. `BootstrapGate` had the same gap on the first-run screen.
 * Neither is visible in the source without knowing what Vuetify emits.
 *
 * ## Which pages, and which not
 *
 * `Settings.vue` (3,433 lines) and `ProjectDetail.vue` (3,007) still cannot be
 * mounted — that is the §2.3 finding and splitting them is its own work item.
 * The other seven always could, and `tests/views-render.spec.js` now mounts
 * them, so they are scanned here too. This file said it was "the reason to add
 * to that list"; this is that.
 *
 * ## Why axe is not the whole of accessibility
 *
 * It never is — axe finds roughly a third of what a manual audit does, and the
 * things it cannot see are the ones this app is most exposed to: whether the
 * operation console announces streaming output to a screen reader, whether a
 * drawer traps focus, whether the whole app is reachable from a keyboard. Those
 * need the E2E run this project does not have yet. An automated pass is the
 * floor, not the ceiling, and a green run here is not a VPAT.
