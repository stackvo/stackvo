/**
 * Starting the real application under `tauri-driver`, and taking it down again.
 *
 * ## What this proves that nothing else in this repository does
 *
 * The Playwright suite drives the front end in a real engine and stubs the one
 * global underneath `ipc.js` → `call()`. That is honest and it is half. It does
 * not start the Rust binary, so it cannot tell anyone whether a command named
 * in `contracts/ipc.json` is actually registered, whether the built bundle
 * loads under the CSP `tauri.conf.json` declares, or whether a failure comes
 * back in ADR 0004's shape. Every one of those has exactly one way to be
 * checked: run the binary and ask it.
 *
 * ## Where it runs, and why the skip is loud
 *
 * Linux CI. Not macOS — Tauri's documentation is explicit that there is no
 * WKWebView driver — and that is a fact about the platform rather than a
 * preference, so [`whyNotHere`] returns prose and the tests skip with it
 * printed. On Linux there is no skip path at all: a missing `tauri-driver` or
 * a missing binary fails, because "the suite was green" and "the suite never
 * ran" must not look the same on the one platform that can tell them apart.
 *
 * ## The machine it runs on is not this machine
 *
 * The application is pointed at a temporary `STACKVO_ROOT` and
 * `STACKVO_CONFIG_DIR`, so a driver run reads and writes a directory that is
 * deleted afterwards. `hosts_roundtrip.rs` made the same argument for
 * `STACKVO_HOSTS_PATH` (§3 #35): a test that touches the developer's real
 * workspace is a test somebody eventually switches off.
