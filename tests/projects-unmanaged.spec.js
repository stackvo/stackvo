/**
 * The unmanaged code moved off the page and behind the overflow button.
 *
 * It used to be a strip above the table — two "point at a XAMPP folder"
 * buttons and, under them, the folders in `projects/` with no `stackvo.json`.
 * Both are things you deal with once, and they were charging every reader
 * vertical space on every visit.
 *
 * The move is only safe while two things hold, and neither is visible from a
 * page that merely mounts:
 *
 * 1. **The count survives.** These folders are invisible everywhere else in
 *    the app, which is the whole reason the strip existed. Moving them behind
 *    a button with nothing on it would make eleven undeclared folders as
 *    invisible as they are in Finder. The badge is the strip's one job.
 * 2. **The panels still open.** A menu item that opens nothing, or a dialog
 *    that renders its two lists empty, looks exactly like a workspace with
 *    nothing to adopt — the failure reads as good news.
