/**
 * The half of the driver suite that can be watched from here.
 *
 * `tauri-driver` does not run on macOS, which is where this repository is
 * developed, so `tests/driver/boot.driver.js` is a file its author can write
 * and never see pass (§3 #12). That is a real hazard and it has a name: code
 * whose first execution is in CI is code whose first execution is in front of
 * everybody.
 *
 * So the client was split. Building a request, reading a response envelope,
 * wrapping a script in the callback protocol and resolving a binary path are
 * all pure, and all of them are places a silent mistake would survive to CI
 * and then look like an environment problem — a wrong capability key reads as
 * "the driver ignored the application", a mis-read error envelope reads as
 * "the app crashed". Those are asserted here, on every platform, in the same
 * runner as the other 700 specs.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* faked: there is no fake WebKitWebDriver. A stub
 * that agreed with this client about the protocol would prove the two halves
 * of one opinion agree, which `tui_probe.rs` already paid this repository the
 * lesson for. The live protocol is CI's question; the shapes are this file's.
