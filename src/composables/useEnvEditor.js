 * The `.env` editor six Settings panes share.
 *
 * This is the machine the readiness review's §2.3 called `useEnvEditor()`, and
 * it is why the split stalled at three panes: the appearance, domain, PHP,
 * server-limits, services and workspace panes all edit the same file through
 * the same four refs, so none of them could leave `Settings.vue` on its own.
 *
 * ## The three-layer read is the whole design
 *
 * A value is whatever the user has typed, or what the file holds, or what the
 * binary ships — in that order. Keeping the layers apart is what lets the form
 * say "this is the default" and offer to go back to it, which is the difference
 * between a settings screen and a wall of populated text fields. Collapsing
 * them into one map at load time would lose that on the first render.
 *
 * ## Edits are a diff, not a copy
 *
 * `edit()` *removes* a key when the value returns to what the file holds, so
 * `dirty` is "is there anything to write" rather than "has anything been
 * touched", and a save writes only what changed. Typing a character and typing
 * it back leaves nothing behind.
