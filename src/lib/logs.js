 * went wrong and none of the lines that say where. So an undeclared line takes
 * the level of the entry it follows.
 *
 * Lines before the first declared level keep `null`, because there is genuinely
 * nothing to inherit: the buffer starts mid-file.
 *
 * Inheritance is **per origin**, keyed on `line.origin`. In a single stream
 * every line shares the one origin and this is the plain running level. In the
 * cross-project tail it is not optional: sixty files interleave into one
 * buffer, so the line above a stack frame is routinely from another project
 * entirely, and a single running level would paint one project's INFO with
 * another's ERROR — and then hide it under a filter that has no idea it is
