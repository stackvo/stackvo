      <!-- Pinned to the default density: the card below is pulled up over this
           toolbar by a fixed amount, so letting the interface-density setting
           shrink it slides the title under the card. Density belongs to the
           controls, not to the page's own geometry.
           
           `extension-height` matches the card's `mt-n16` (64px) on purpose.
           The title is centred in the 100px band, so the blue above it is
           `(100 - title) / 2`; below it that same gap is reduced by however
           much the card is pulled up past the extension. At Vuetify's default
           48 the card ate 16px more than the extension gave back, and the
           header sat visibly low in its own band. -->
      <!-- `tag="div"`, not the default `<header>`. Vuetify's toolbar renders a
           `<header>`, which is a `banner` landmark — and `App.vue`'s app bar is
           already the banner for the whole window. With the default, a screen
           reader offered three of them on every page (the app bar, this, and
           the inner bar below) and no way to tell them apart. Caught by the axe
           pass in `tests/a11y-axe.spec.js` once the pages could be mounted. -->
