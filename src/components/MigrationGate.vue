/**
 * The fourth of the pattern, and the only one that is not skippable.
 *
 * ADR 0016. StackVo used to render its services from `.env` and a set of
 * templates compiled into the binary; it renders them from `instances.json` and
 * a package tree now, and as of this version the first branch is gone. A
 * workspace that still keeps its services in `.env` therefore cannot build a
 * stack at all — not a degraded one, none — so this screen is a wall where
 * `CatalogueGate` is a door.
 *
 * ## Why not a banner
 *
 * Because a banner is for something that can be ignored. The three answers §5
 * weighed were a forced migration, two paths for one release, and a silent one;
 * two paths is what was already happening and is what left the catalogue with
 * two lists that disagree, and a silent migration changes somebody's service
 * definitions without asking — which this codebase refuses elsewhere for
 * smaller things than this (`env_reveal` makes *reading* a password an act).
 *
 * ## What is offered, and what happens if it is declined
 *
 * The plan is shown before anything is written: which services, which versions,
 * which ports and volumes they will keep. `.env` is copied to
 * `.env.pre-market.bak` first and its service lines are commented out, so the
 * whole thing is reversible and the Market page keeps the panel that reverses
 * it.
 *
 * Declining leaves the app open with no services — and that is deliberately not
 * nothing: without them StackVo is still a reverse proxy, a certificate
 * authority and a project runner, which is exactly the argument `CatalogueGate`
 * makes about a machine with no catalogue. What declining does not do is let
 * the old stack come back, because the code that built it no longer exists.
 *
 * ## Blockers are shown, not swallowed
 *
 * A plan can be inapplicable — a service enabled in `.env` that the catalogue
 * has no package for, a port that something else has taken since. Those are
 * listed with names, because the repair is the user's and naming it is the
 * whole of the help this screen can give.
