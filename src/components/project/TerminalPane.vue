/**
 * A shell inside this project's container, in the window.
 *
 * The app has offered "open a terminal" since the port, and it has always meant
 * the *system* terminal — `terminal_open_external`, which launches Terminal.app
 * or its equivalent. That still exists and is still the right answer when
 * somebody wants their own shell with their own profile. This is the other
 * half: a session that lives beside the project it belongs to, which is what
 * `pty.rs` was written for and what nothing had ever called.
 *
 * ## Loaded on demand
 *
 * xterm and its fit addon are imported inside `start()` rather than at the top
 * of the file. They are ~250 KB that only a user who asks for a shell needs,
 * and a static import would put them in the bundle every project page pays
 * for — including the ones with no container to attach to.
 *
 * ## Not opened automatically
 *
 * Mounting a pane must not spawn a process. Every other pane on this page reads
 * something; this one would start a shell in a container merely because the
 * page scrolled far enough to render it, and would keep doing so on every
 * visit.
