/**
 * Material's modal side sheet, as the app's second surface for detail.

 * difference that matters for a panel you read against a list. Vuetify has no
 * side-sheet component — a `v-navigation-drawer` is the closest thing, and it
 * needs the same four corrections every time, so they live here rather than in
 * each panel that wants one:
 *
 *   - the layout insets a drawer below whatever claimed the top edge and hands
 *     it a z-index under the app bar, so a modal panel opens with one bright,
 *     clickable strip of window above its own scrim;
 *   - the edge border is for a drawer docked beside content, not for one
 *     floating over it, where the same hairline reads as a seam;
 *   - Escape closes a dialog for free and a drawer not at all;
 *   - and the leading corner is the shape that says "this slid in".

  <!-- Teleported to the document body.
       A sheet opened from inside a page renders inside `v-main`, whose stacking
       context the app bar's is not inside — so the bar paints over the sheet's
       header however high the sheet's own z-index is, and a page with
       `overflow: hidden` clips the panel outright. Moving the element to the
       body settles both; the layout injection follows the component tree, not
       the DOM, so Vuetify still treats it as a layout item. -->
