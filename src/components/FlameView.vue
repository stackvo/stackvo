/**
 * A profile as nested bars: what called what, and how much each branch cost.
 *
 * F-3. The table beside this answers "where did the time go"; it cannot answer
 * "what called that", which is the question that turns a slow page into a
 * fixed one.
 *
 * ## An icicle, not a flame
 *
 * Root at the top and growing downward. A classic flame graph is inverted —
 * root at the bottom — which reads well as an image and badly in a scrolling
 * pane: the thing you look at first ends up wherever the deepest stack happens
 * to put it. Downward means the entry point is where the eye starts and depth
 * is where the scroll goes.
 *
 * ## Width is share of the parent, not of the total
 *
 * A branch that is 90% of its caller reads as 90% wide inside it, whatever the
 * caller is a share of. That is what makes a deep tree readable at all: widths
 * relative to the root would make everything below the third level a hairline,
 * which is exactly when somebody stops being able to click it.
 *
 * ## Rendered as divs, not SVG or canvas
 *
 * The rows are text with a background, and text in a div is selectable,
 * searchable with the browser's own find, and reachable by keyboard. A canvas
 * would need every one of those written by hand, and this repository has a
 * browser suite (§3 #12) that would then have nothing to assert against — a
 * canvas is one node with no accessible name.
