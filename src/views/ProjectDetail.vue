   rather than from a media query of its own — the labels are not hidden here,
   they were never rendered.

   Centring is the part worth saying out loud. `v-list-item` is a three-column
   grid — prepend, content, append — and the gap after the icon is not a margin
   but a `.v-list-item__spacer` element, 32px wide by default. With the label
   gone that spacer stays, holding the prepend column wider than the item, so
   the icon sits left of centre and hangs over the edge of its own highlight.
   Zero it through the variable it reads, then let the prepend span all three
   columns so "centre" means the item rather than the column the icon is in. */
