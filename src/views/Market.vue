                 services, a service holds versions. It replaced a vertical tab
                 rail over expansion panels — two collapsing mechanisms stacked,
                 each with its own idea of where you were.

                 The `eager` those panels carried is not needed here and is not
                 missing: `VTreeview` writes every descendant into the document
                 and collapses it visually, so all twenty-five services are
                 still findable by a browser and surveyable by a screen reader
                 with the tree shut. Measured, not read about.

                 `prepend-gap="0"` is what makes the indent lines visible, and
                 it is not a spacing choice. The md3 blueprint this app runs
                 sets `VList: { prependGap: 16 }`; `VList` turns any prepend gap
                 into `--v-list-group-prepend: 0px`, `--prepend-width` reads
                 that, and the lines are a grid of
                 `repeat(var(--v-indent-parts), var(--prepend-width))` — so
                 every column is zero pixels wide. The vertical trunk survives,
                 because a 1px left border still paints on a zero-width box; the
                 elbows are `width: 100%` of that box and vanish. One line down
                 the left and nothing else, which is a plausible-looking tree
                 and is why it took a while to see. Rendered both ways in a real
                 browser before this was written. -->

                  <!-- Icons with the label in a tooltip. `icon` is a bare flag
                     and the glyph goes in the slot: Vuetify reads
                     `icon="mdi-…"` only while the slot is empty, and a tooltip
                     *is* slot content — the prop form renders a blank button
                     and nothing complains. `button-icons.spec.js` holds that
                     rule.

                     `.stop` on every one of them: the row opens on click, and
                     a click that installed a package *and* toggled the node it
                     was on would be one act reported as two. -->

                 shrinking every cell until the container names and the domains
                 are ellipses, which loses exactly the two things somebody came
                 to this row to read.

                 `hover` because eight columns is a long way for an eye to
                 travel and the row is the only thing tying the container name
                 at one end to the Remove button at the other.

                 No `fixed-header`, and that is the whole reason the heading row
                 can be transparent. A sticky header needs something opaque
                 behind it or the rows slide visibly under it — so it is one or
