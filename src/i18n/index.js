/**
 * Load every language pack on this machine and register it (M-7).

 * A pack is one JSON file in the app's config directory with the same shape as
 * `locales/en.js`. Adding a language is therefore a file somebody drops in,
 * not a source change and a rebuild — which is what "the app speaks N
 * languages" is supposed to mean, and what it did not mean while the language
 * set was a constant in three places.
 *
 * ## Merged over English, not used alone
 *
 * `fallbackLocale: 'en'` would already cover a missing key, but Vuetify's own
 * strings live under `$vuetify` and a pack has no reason to carry them. So each
 * pack is registered as English with the pack's own strings on top: an
 * untranslated screen is in English rather than showing raw keys, and the
 * library's labels are never the pack's problem.
 *
 * ## A broken pack is reported, not skipped
 *
 * A hand-edited file with a trailing comma that simply vanishes from the
 * picker is the worst failure this could have. `locale_packs` lists it with its
 * parse error and the settings pane says so; this function leaves it
 * unregistered, which is the only safe thing to do with a file that did not
 * parse.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<string[]>} the tags that were registered.
