/**
 * A lazy route whose chunk cannot be fetched, recovered rather than swallowed.
 *
 * Vue Router aborts a navigation whose async component rejects, and it does so
 * silently: the sidebar item never becomes active, the old page stays, and
 * nothing appears on screen. A click that does literally nothing is the worst
 * possible failure mode — it reads as a dead button rather than a broken load.
 *
 * The chunk really can go missing. In dev, Vite discovers a new dependency the
 * first time a view is transformed, re-bundles, and invalidates the URLs the
 * in-flight import was using — the request fails with "Importing a module
 * script failed", and because a failed dynamic import stays failed for the life
 * of the document, every later click on that item fails too. Vite's own answer
 * to this is a full reload, so take it: one reload puts the page back on the
 * fresh dependency graph and the route loads.
 *
 * Rate-limited rather than once-per-session: a genuinely broken build must not
 * reload in a loop, but a second, unrelated failure an hour later still
 * deserves its own recovery.
