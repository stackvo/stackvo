/**
 * The front end's types, generated from the contract.
 *
 *   node tools/generate-types.mjs           # write src/lib/ipc.d.ts
 *   node tools/generate-types.mjs --check   # fail if it is not current
 *
 * ## Why this and not `tauri-specta` (§3 #10)
 *
 * ADR 0006 measured `tauri-specta` and deferred it, on the cost of changing how
 * every command is declared. Re-measured before this was written, and one fact
 * settles it for this repository rather than merely delaying it:
 *
 * **There is no TypeScript here.** No `tsconfig.json`, no `.ts` file, no
 * `lang="ts"` in any of the 135 `.js`/`.vue` sources. `tauri-specta`'s output is
 * a TypeScript module of typed `invoke` wrappers — in a project with no
 * compiler configured, that is a file nothing reads and nothing checks, bought
 * with three new crates and an attribute on 245 command functions.
 *
 * The gap §3 #10 names is "the front end stays untyped". The generator was
 * never what was missing; the *types* were. And the contract already is the
 * single source of truth, already hand-written by ADR 0006's decision, and
 * already gated against the implementation by `contract_agreement.rs`. So the
 * types come from there, into a `.d.ts` — which editors apply to plain
 * JavaScript with no build step, no compiler and no file renamed.
 *
 * ## What this does not do, and it is the honest half
 *
 * A `.d.ts` beside JavaScript is **editor** typing: autocompletion, argument
 * names, a red squiggle on a misspelled command. It is not a build gate. Making
 * it one means `tsc --noEmit --checkJs` over 135 files, which is a cleanup with
 * its own size and its own decision. This is the half that has no prerequisite.
 *
 * ## The types are as good as the contract's prose, and that is measured
 *
 * `contracts/ipc.json` describes arguments as prose that begins with a type:
 * `"string — an https:// address"`, `"bool (default false)"`, `"string?"`. The
 * leading token is parsed and the rest is kept as the doc comment. Anything
 * this cannot read becomes `unknown` rather than a guess, and the count of
 * those is written into the generated header — a number that goes up is a
 * contract entry somebody wrote in a new shape, and it should be visible rather
 * than silently typed as `any`.
