# §3 #12. The driver suite needs more than a plain `cargo test`: the front end
# built, the application built the way it SHIPS, `tauri-driver` on PATH, and a
# display, because the app opens a window.
#
# `npx tauri build --debug --no-bundle`, not `cargo build`. A plain cargo build
# embeds `devUrl` — the webview opens http://localhost:1420, gets "connection
# refused", and every test reports an empty `#app` with no explanation. So the
# headline test of this suite, "the built bundle renders inside the real
# webview", could never pass with the profile the suite itself chose.
# `--no-bundle` because what is wanted is a binary to drive, not a .deb.
#
# `STACKVO_DRIVER_BINARY` because the container builds into `target-linux/` (so
# a Linux object file never lands in the macOS target dir and invalidates it),
# while `binaryPath()` looks in `target/`.
