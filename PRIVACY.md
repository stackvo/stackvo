# Privacy

## The short version

**There is no telemetry, and there is no plan to add any.** Nothing about how
you use this app is counted, sampled or sent anywhere. There is no account, no
sign-in, no crash reporting service and no server behind the app: it talks to
your own Docker daemon and your own filesystem, and the only thing it contacts
on its own initiative is the update endpoint — described below, and only from
the Settings screen.

This document exists because "we don't collect anything" is not a fact until
somebody writes down what "anything" was measured against. The readiness review
made the point in the other direction: a tool that quietly collects nothing and
a tool that quietly collects something look identical from the outside, so
silence is not a privacy property.

### If that ever changes

Any future telemetry would be **opt-in, off by default, and described here
before it ships**, with the payload listed field by field on the screen that
offers it. An update that starts sending something without that is a defect, not
a decision — report it as one (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).

## What is stored, and where

Everything here is a plain file on your own machine. Nothing is encrypted at
rest and nothing needs a password to read, because none of it leaves the
account it belongs to.

Deleting all four of the app's own locations is supported and loses nothing but
settings and history. The workspace is separate on purpose: it is the stack, not
the app.

**One file is read and never written**, and it is worth naming here because it
is the only one somebody other than you may have put there: a policy file at
`/Library/Managed Preferences/com.stackvo.desktop.json` (macOS),
`%ProgramData%\StackVo\policy.json` (Windows) or `/etc/stackvo/policy.json`
(Linux). If your machine is managed, that file can set app settings, prevent
you from changing them, and **redirect every image pull to a registry your
organisation runs** rather than Docker Hub. **Settings** shows you when one is
in force and which file it is. Nothing is sent to it or about it; it is an
input, not a destination.

### What the log contains

Command lines the app runs, the output of `docker compose` and of the StackVo
CLI, the paths involved, and errors. That is enough to reconstruct what you were
doing with the app on a given day, which is exactly why the files stay on your
machine and rotate away after a week.

Values of keys the app knows to be secrets — `*_PASSWORD`, `*_SECRET`,
`*_TOKEN`, `*_KEY` and their family, as `config::Env::is_secret` defines it —
are **masked before the line is written**. The mask is applied a second time
when a diagnostic bundle is built, because a bundle made today can carry lines
written by an older build whose masking rule was narrower.

### What a diagnostic bundle contains

`about.txt` (version, platform), `preflight.json`, `doctor.json`,
`engine.json`, the rotating log files and any crash reports — each log capped at
1 MiB, with `truncated` naming the ones that were cut. **It does not include
`.env`, and it does not include project sources.** It is plain text and JSON so
that you can read it before you send it; the file listing is shown in the app
rather than a bare "saved" confirmation, for the same reason.

Where a bundle goes afterwards is entirely your decision — the app writes the
file and nothing else.

## What leaves this machine

### On the app's own initiative

| `raw.githubusercontent.com` — the update endpoint in `tauri.conf.json` | When the **Settings** screen is opened, and when you press _Check for updates_. Not at launch, and not at all when the build has no update public key compiled in. | An ordinary HTTPS GET for a static `latest.json`. The app adds no identifier, no version parameter and no cookie. As with any HTTP request, whoever serves the file sees your IP address and the request time. |
| `127.0.0.1` — the mail catcher                                         | While the mail screen is open                                                                                                                                      | Loopback only. This traffic never reaches a network interface, and the HTTP client for it is built with `no_proxy()` precisely so a corporate proxy setting cannot pull it off the machine.                    |

That is the complete list. Everything else below happens because you asked for
it.

### Because you asked for it

| What you do                     | Where it goes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Create a project from a Git URL | The remote **you** typed, over the credentials your own `git` is configured with                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Start the stack                 | Whatever registry the images name — Docker Hub by default, or the one a policy file on a managed machine names instead. Your Docker daemon does this, with its own configuration                                                                                                     |
| Open a share tunnel             | `cloudflared` publishes the site at a `trycloudflare.com` address. **The URL is public**: anyone who has it reaches the site on your machine, without a password, until you stop the tunnel                                                                                          |
| Follow a link in the app        | Your browser opens it. The app's own links point at `stackvo.github.io`, `github.com`, `docs.docker.com`, and — from the support and share menus — `bsky.app`, `buymeacoffee.com`, `discord.gg`, `fosstodon.org`, `reddit.com`, `twitter.com`, `www.linkedin.com`, `www.youtube.com` |
| Fetch the service catalogue     | The address **you** chose, or the mirror `policy.market.registryUrl` names on a managed machine. The app suggests the `github.com/stackvo/stackvo-service-packages` repository, which it translates to `raw.githubusercontent.com` before fetching, and nothing fetches anything until you press the button — a first run with no network shows the catalogue gate and stays there. Plain `http://` is refused. The request carries an `If-None-Match` for the copy already here and no identifier of any kind; the system proxy is used, unlike the mail client above, because on a managed network the mirror is only reachable through it |
| Install a service package       | The same address. Nothing else is contacted — the image itself is pulled later, by your Docker daemon, from whatever registry the package names                                                                                                                                       |
| Send a diagnostic bundle        | Wherever you send it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### While Docker builds an image

The generated Dockerfiles fetch packages during the build, from
`deb.nodesource.com` (Node.js), `dl.cloudsmith.io` (Caddy) and `rubygems.org`
(Ruby), plus whatever the base images pull from their own package mirrors. This
is Docker's network activity, on the machine, driven by files the app writes
into your workspace — you can read every one of them before building.

---

## What this app is _not_ protecting you from

Naming these is more useful than a reassurance:

- **Database passwords are on the disk in plain text, in two files.** `.env`
  holds them, and so does `generated/docker-compose.dynamic.yml`, which is what
  Compose actually reads and which is rendered from `.env` on every generate.
  File permissions are the only boundary. On a managed machine `.env` is also
  whatever your backup and sync tools do with it.

  **Settings → Where credentials are kept** moves a credential into this
  machine's keystore — Keychain, Credential Manager, or the Secret Service —
  and leaves a `keychain:` reference in `.env` in its place. That takes it out
  of the file that gets backed up, synced and pasted into support threads. **It
  does not take it off the disk**: the real value is still rendered into
  `generated/docker-compose.dynamic.yml`, because that is where Compose reads it
  from. Getting it out of there too changes the generated bytes and is tracked
  as a v2 change — see
  [ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-secrets-move-out-of-env-not-off-the-disk.md).

  The `stackvo.sh` command-line tool cannot read a moved credential and would
  use the reference string as the password. If you use both tools on one
  workspace, leave the credentials in `.env`.

- **Docker access is total.** The app manages containers, so it can read and
  write anything those containers mount — including your project sources.
- **A tunnel is a publication.** See above; it is the one action in the app that
  makes something on your machine reachable from the internet.
- **The app runs as you.** It is not a boundary against someone who already has
  your user account.

## How this document is kept true

`src-tauri/tests/privacy_claims.rs` scans the shipped code — the Rust
production regions, the front end, and the updater endpoint in
`tauri.conf.json` — for every host it can reach, and **fails the build if one of
them is not named in this file**. A dependency or a feature that starts talking
to somewhere new cannot land quietly; the build stops until this page says so.

What the test cannot settle is a claim about intent — "no telemetry" is not a
string a parser can find. What it can settle is the surface that claim is made
about, and that is what it holds.
