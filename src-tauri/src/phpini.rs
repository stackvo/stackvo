//! `memory_limit` and the rest of `php.ini`, per project.
//!
//! ## Why this is a feature and not a form
//!
//! `docs/*/configuration/project.md` documents `.stackvo/php.ini` as a project
//! config file, and the old web UI's `DockerService.js:388` listed it as one.
//! Neither was true: `php.ini` appears **nowhere** in `core/cli`. No generator
//! mounts it, no Dockerfile copies it. Dropping the file in did exactly nothing,
//! and the previous attempt at a settings form was cut on that evidence — it
//! would have written carefully validated values into a file no process reads.
//!
//! So the mount has to come first. Every competitor exposes `memory_limit` and
//! `upload_max_filesize`; a PHP environment that cannot raise an upload limit is
//! not finished.
//!
//! ## Where it goes, and why there
//!
//! Every PHP image the generator builds on — `php:X-fpm`, `php:X-apache`,
//! `php:X-cli` for Swoole, and FrankenPHP, which is itself built on the official
//! image — reads `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/*.ini` after the main `php.ini`.
//! The file lands there as `zz-stackvo.ini`: `zz` sorts after the
//! `docker-php-ext-*.ini` files the build writes, and last-parsed wins, so a
//! value set here is the value PHP ends up with.
//!
//! Mounted read-only. The container has no business writing to the user's
//! source tree, and a `:ro` mount says so in the one place anybody would look.
//!
//! ## Why an overlay, again
//!
//! Same reason as [`crate::xdebug`]: the compose generator's output is under a
//! byte-for-byte contract with the Bash implementation, so adding a volume to it
//! from this side alone would break the check that makes the port safe. Compose
//! layers files instead, so this writes a fifth `-f` that the generator neither
//! produces nor knows about. It is re-derived on every compose invocation and
//! never stored, because an overlay naming a deleted project declares a service
//! with no image and no build context, and compose then refuses *every* command
//! against the whole stack — including the `down` that would clear it.
//!
//! Its own file rather than a section of the Xdebug overlay: the two are
//! independent (one adds `volumes`, the other `environment`), and sharing a
//! document means a fault in one can take the other down with it.
//!
//! ## The three states, kept apart
//!
//! Like Xdebug, "on" is not one boolean:
//!
//! 1. **On disk** — the file exists under `projects/<name>/.stackvo/`.
//! 2. **Mounted** — the running container actually has it. Read from the
//!    container, never inferred: `stackvo up` from the Bash CLI layers three
//!    files, not five, and will recreate the container without this mount.
//! 3. **Applied** — PHP reads its ini once, at process start. Editing a value
//!    in a bind-mounted file changes nothing until the container restarts.
//!
//! Reporting them separately is what stops "I set memory_limit and nothing
//! happened" turning into an afternoon in the wrong config file.
