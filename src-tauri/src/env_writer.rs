//! Editing `.env` without destroying it.
//!
//! StackVo's `.env` is 159 keys with section banners, explanatory comments and
//! deliberate blank lines. Serialising a parsed map back out would produce a
//! valid file that is worthless to the human who maintains it — so this module
//! never rewrites the file, it patches lines in place.
//!
//! Rules:
//!   - An existing key keeps its line number, its surrounding whitespace and
//!     any trailing comment on that line.
//!   - A new key is appended under a generated section, never interleaved.
//!   - Everything else in the file is byte-identical afterwards.
//!   - The previous contents are saved to `.env.bak` before the first write.
