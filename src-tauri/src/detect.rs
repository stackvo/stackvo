//! What is this folder, and how should StackVo run it?
//!
//! The gap this closes is narrow and concrete: `project_create` refuses when
//! the directory already exists, so a folder someone cloned into `projects/`
//! could not be adopted at all. On the checkout this was written against, 11 of
//! 21 directories under `projects/` were in exactly that state — real code,
//! sitting unmanaged, because writing `stackvo.json` by hand is the only way in.
//!
//! Lerd auto-detects nine frameworks and Laragon's "Quick app" carries its whole
//! onboarding story; both are the same idea from the other end.
//!
//! ## Evidence, not a verdict
//!
//! Every detection carries the files it was based on and a confidence. That is
//! not decoration. Inferring a document root wrong produces a project that
//! builds, starts, and serves a 404 — a failure with no error attached to it —
//! and the user's only defence is being able to see that the guess came from
//! `index.php` in the root rather than from an `artisan` file that is not there.
//!
//! ## Why the inference is pure
//!
//! `fingerprint` touches the disk; `infer` does not. Everything worth arguing
//! about — does a `composer.json` naming `laravel/framework` outrank an
//! `index.php` in the root, what happens when a repository holds both a PHP API
//! and a Vite front end — is a decision over a struct, tested without a fixture
//! tree on disk.
