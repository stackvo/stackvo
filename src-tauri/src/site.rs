//! Two per-project settings that reach the container through this app's own
//! layers rather than through the manifest (M-5, M-6).
//!
//! ## Why they share a file
//!
//! They are the same kind of thing: a switch somebody sets on one project, that
//! the generator cannot read from the manifest because
//! `contracts/project.schema.json` is `additionalProperties: false` and the
//! contract is frozen. `.stackvo/` is the established answer — `php.ini`,
//! `xdebug.json`, `devserver.json` and `perf.json` are all there, and all of
//! them travel with the project when a teammate clones it.
//!
//! Two settings, one file, because a second file per switch is how a directory
//! becomes a place people stop looking.
//!
//! ## Where each one lands, and why that is not the same place
//!
//! **Environment variables** go into the compose overlay, as `environment:` on
//! the project's service. They are the container's, not the web server's, and a
//! `.env` inside the project would be the application's own file — which this
//! app has no business writing, because Laravel, Symfony and every framework
//! since already own it.
//!
//! **Directory listing** goes into the *server* configuration, because that is
//! what it is: `autoindex on` for nginx, `file_server browse` for Caddy. It
//! reuses the per-project server-directives mechanism that already exists
//! rather than adding a second path into the same file.
//!
//! ## What this refuses
//!
//! A value with a newline in it. The overlay is YAML and the directive block is
//! nginx configuration, and in both a newline in a value is not an escaping
//! problem to solve — it is a second directive somebody else wrote.
