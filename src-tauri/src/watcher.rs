//! Watching `projects/*/stackvo.json` for edits.
//!
//! StackVo's config flow is manual: edit a manifest, remember to run
//! `stackvo generate`, remember to restart. Forgetting either leaves the
//! containers running against a stale Dockerfile with nothing to indicate it.
//!
//! A host process can just watch the files. This module does not regenerate
//! anything on its own — it emits `manifest:changed` and lets the UI offer the
//! action, because silently rebuilding a container underneath someone who is
//! mid-edit is worse than the problem it solves.
