//! Running the StackVo CLI and `docker compose`, streaming their output.
//!
//! Two things this fixes relative to the web UI:
//!
//!   1. **No shell.** `ProjectService` built command strings and handed them to
//!      `execAsync`, which spawns `/bin/sh -c`. That is why the codebase needed
//!      an `assertSafeName` regex guarding every interpolated value. Here every
//!      argument is a separate array element, so a project named `a; rm -rf ~`
//!      is a name that does not exist, not a command that runs.
//!
//!   2. **No buffering.** `execAsync` resolves once the process exits, so a
//!      ten-minute build produced nothing until it finished — hence the 600s
//!      proxy timeout in the old nginx config. Here stdout and stderr are read
//!      line by line and emitted as they arrive.
