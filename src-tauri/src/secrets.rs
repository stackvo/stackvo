//! Database passwords in the OS keystore instead of in a text file.
//!
//! `.env` holds the stack's configuration and, today, its credentials. On a
//! company machine that file is backed up, synced to a laptop, and scanned by
//! whatever the organisation runs — which is the readiness review's §5.2, and
//! it is a fair complaint about a file whose whole purpose is to be copied
//! around.
//!
//! A key that has been moved reads like this:
//!
//! ```text
//! SERVICE_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=keychain:SERVICE_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD@a1b2c3d4
//! ```
//!
//! and the value lives in Keychain (macOS), Credential Manager (Windows) or the
//! Secret Service (Linux), under the service name `stackvo`.
//!
//! ## What this removes, and what it does not
//!
//! It takes the password out of `.env`. It does **not** take it off the disk,
//! and pretending otherwise would be the same mistake ADR 0009 refused to make
//! about the policy file.
//!
//! `generated/docker-compose.dynamic.yml` is rendered from
//! `{{ SERVICE_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD }}`, so the real value is substituted into
//! it — as it always has been. The secret was never in one file; it was in two,
//! and §5.2 only counted the first. What changes is *which* file: `.env` is
//! hand-maintained, quoted in support threads, and the thing a backup tool is
//! pointed at, while `generated/` is output that ADR 0002 says is rewritten from
//! scratch on every run. Moving the value from the first to the second is a real
//! reduction and a partial one, and the honest thing is to say which.
//!
//! Getting it out of `generated/` as well means emitting `${VAR}` and feeding
//! the value to `docker compose` through its environment. That changes the
//! rendered bytes, which breaks the differential comparison against the Bash
//! generator, and it breaks `docker compose up` run by hand in that directory.
//! It is a v2 change and it is described in ADR 0010 rather than half-done here.
//!
//! ## The Bash CLI cannot read these, and that is the sharp edge
//!
//! `stackvo.sh` reads `.env` directly. Handed `keychain:…` it will use that
//! string as the password — so a fresh MySQL container comes up with a root
//! password nobody meant, and nothing announces it. This is why moving a key is
//! an explicit act with a warning attached and never something the app does on
//! its own, and why `doctor` reports a workspace that has both.
//!
//! ## The reference is data, not a derivation
//!
//! The entry name is written into `.env` and read back from there. It is
//! *generated* from the key and a digest of the workspace path — so two
//! workspaces do not fight over one Keychain entry — but it is never
//! *recomputed* to look a value up. Moving a workspace directory therefore does
//! not orphan its secrets, which recomputing would do silently and only for
//! people who move directories.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- the store
//
// ## Why the backend is split by `cfg(test)` rather than by an environment
// variable
//
// `hosts.rs` has `STACKVO_HOSTS_PATH` and `elevate.rs` has
// `STACKVO_POWERSHELL`, and both are the right shape for what they redirect: a
// file this app writes, and a program it spawns. A seam of that shape here
// would be different in kind — an environment variable that moves *passwords*
// out of the OS keystore and into wherever it points, in a shipped binary,
// set by anything that can start this process.
//
// So the redirection is `cfg(test)`, which the compiler enforces: a released
// build has no other backend to reach, and a unit test has no way to reach the
// real one. That is stronger than a seam, and it is available here for a reason
// it was not available to `hosts.rs` — the only caller that needed it is a unit
// test inside this crate.
//
// ## What it was fixing
//
// `env_writer::tests::a_moved_key_is_taken_out_of_the_file_patch` calls
// `redirect_moved_keys`, which writes to the store. Its comment said the write
// "succeeds on a developer's machine". It does not: macOS asks for Keychain
// access whenever the binary asking has changed, which after `cargo build` is
// every time — and with nobody to answer the prompt the test **hangs**, taking
// the whole `cargo test` run with it. A suite that cannot finish is a suite
// nobody runs, which is ADR 0028's whole subject.
