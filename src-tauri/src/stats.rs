//! Host metrics, read on the host.
//!
//! This module replaces `HostStatsService.js` (293 lines). That file read
//! `/proc/stat`, `/proc/meminfo` and `/proc/net/dev` from *inside a container*,
//! so on Linux it reported the container's constrained view and on macOS — where
//! there is no `/proc` at all — it silently fell through to estimating CPU from
//! `os.loadavg()`. Every number on the dashboard was either scoped wrong or a
//! guess.
//!
//! Running on the host makes the problem disappear rather than solving it.
//!
//! Two numbers the dashboard shows that `sysinfo` alone cannot supply, and how
//! they are obtained honestly rather than approximated:
//!   - **CPU user/nice/system/idle.** `systemstat` reads the platform's own CPU
//!     time counters (mach `host_statistics64` on macOS, `/proc/stat` on Linux,
//!     `GetSystemTimes` on Windows). It needs two samples separated in time,
//!     so the first call after startup reports nothing rather than guessing.
//!   - **Disk read/write throughput.** Summed from per-process disk usage,
//!     which sysinfo does expose everywhere. That is the I/O this machine's
//!     processes actually performed, not a device-level counter — close enough
//!     to be useful and, unlike the old `/proc/diskstats` read from inside a
//!     container, actually about this machine.
