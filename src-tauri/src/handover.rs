//! Handing the service state in `.env` over to the instance table.
//!
//! Faz 2 of `docs/servis-market-mimarisi.md`, and the one piece of it that
//! touches a workspace somebody is already using. Everything else in this
//! sprint is new code with no users; this reads a file that has seven services
//! switched on in it and decides what happens to their data.
//!
//! So it is a **plan first and a write second**. [`plan`] is pure: it reads,
//! decides, and returns what it would do together with every note and every
//! reason it cannot. Nothing on disk changes until a caller looks at the plan
//! and applies it. That split is the difference between "the migration failed
//! halfway" and "the migration did not start".
//!
//! ## The three rules that keep data where it is
//!
//! **The volume is adopted, never renamed.** A fresh `mysql@8.0` would get
//! `stackvo-mysql-8-0-data`; a migrated one keeps `stackvo-mysql-data`, because
//! that is where the rows are. Renaming a Docker volume is a copy, and a copy
//! of a database somebody is using is the slowest possible way to lose it.
//!
//! **The port is kept unless the machine has taken it.** It is the number in
//! somebody's TablePlus, their `.env`, their notes. It is also almost always
//! free — it is the port this very service was using — so the honest failure
//! case is narrow and gets a note rather than a stop.
//!
//! **The old name is kept as an alias.** The migrated instance is `primary`, so
//! `stackvo-mysql` still resolves and every project's `DB_HOST` keeps working.
//! One per service, which is all a single-version workspace has.
//!
//! ## What stops it
//!
//! A version that is enabled in `.env` and absent from the catalogue is a
//! **blocker**, not a nudge to the nearest neighbour. Silently migrating
//! `mysql@5.7` to 8.0 because 5.7 was withdrawn is an upgrade nobody asked for,
//! performed on a datadir, without a backup. ADR 0014's rule that a published
//! version is never removed exists so this stays a case that only a mistake can
//! produce — and when it is produced, this says so.
