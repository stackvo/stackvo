//! The wildcard certificate, and whether anything trusts it.
//!
//! HTTPS already worked before this module existed, and was entirely invisible.
//! mkcert issues a wildcard certificate covering the
//! dashboard and every project domain, and `traefik.sh` installs it as the
//! default certificate — but nothing in the app could say whether mkcert was
//! present, whether the CA was trusted, whether the certificate had expired, or
//! which domains it actually covered. A user whose brand-new project opened to a
//! browser warning had no way to find out why, and the answer was almost always
//! the same: the certificate was issued before that project existed.
//!
//! Two things the Bash helper does not do, and this does:
//!
//! * **Trust on Linux and Windows.** `trust_ca_in_keychain` opens with
//!   `[[ "$OSTYPE" != "darwin"* ]] && return 0`, so on every other platform the
//!   CA is generated, referenced by Traefik, and trusted by nobody.
//! * **Honouring `DEFAULT_TLD_SUFFIX`.** The helper hardcodes `stackvo.loc` in
//!   `get_project_domains` while `.env` offers the suffix as a setting. Change
//!   it and every service domain silently falls outside the certificate.
//!
//! The SAN list and the expiry are read out of the certificate file rather than
//! inferred from the project list, because the file is what the browser
//! validates against. A list of what *should* be covered agrees with the
//! certificate right up until the moment it matters.
