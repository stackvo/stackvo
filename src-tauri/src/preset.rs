//! Stack presets — the shareable half of a StackVo configuration.
//!
//! ## What is actually missing
//!
//! The roadmap item said "turn the commit-friendly `stackvo.json` into a flow".
//! Read against the code, that framing is wrong in a way worth recording:
//! `stackvo.json` needs no flow at all. It already sits in the project
//! directory, it is already schema-validated, and a teammate who clones the
//! repository already has it. Exporting it would be a button that copies a file
//! out of a repository into the same repository.
//!
//! What a teammate does **not** get is the *stack*: which of the twenty
//! services are enabled and at which versions. That lives in `<root>/.env`,
//! which is the one file nobody commits, because it is also where every
//! password is. So the clone succeeds, the manifest is perfect, and the project
//! still will not start until somebody says out loud "you need MySQL 8.0,
//! Redis and Elasticsearch turned on". That sentence is the preset.
//!
//! ## A preset can never carry a secret
//!
//! Enforced by construction, not by filtering.
//!
//! * [`ServicePreset`] holds `enabled` and `version` — two named fields, not a
//!   passthrough map. There is no code path by which
//!   `SERVICE_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` reaches a preset: it is not that a filter
//!   drops it, it is that there is nowhere to put it.
//! * [`SHAREABLE`] is an **allow-list** of global keys. A deny-list would be
//!   wrong here even though [`crate::config::Env::is_secret`] exists, because
//!   that matches on suffix (`PASSWORD`, `TOKEN`, `SECRET`…) — a key added
//!   upstream tomorrow called `SERVICE_FOO_APIKEY` would sail straight through
//!   it. An allow-list fails closed against a file this app does not own.
//!
//! Checked twice: `no_secret_can_reach_a_preset` here runs a fixture full of
//! passwords through an export, and `no_real_secret_survives_a_preset_export`
//! in `tests/real_checkout.rs` does the same against whatever is genuinely in
//! `.env` on this machine — 12 real secrets on the checkout this was written
//! against.
//!
//! That second test earned its place immediately by failing for the *wrong*
//! reason: `SERVICE_GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin`, and `admin` is a substring
//! of the service ids `phpmyadmin`, `pgadmin` and `phpcacheadmin`, which a
//! preset legitimately contains. The repair was to compare exactly against the
//! strings actually in the document rather than to raise a length threshold —
//! the threshold would have quietened a coincidence by letting a real
//! five-character secret through.
//!
//! ## Import is reviewed, then applied
//!
//! The same shape as `hosts_plan`/`hosts_apply` and `cert_plan`/`cert_apply`:
//! [`plan`] says exactly what would change and [`apply`] does it, so importing
//! a colleague's file is never a blind write over your own stack. Writing goes
//! through [`crate::env_writer`], which already backs the file up, preserves
//! comments and ordering, and serialises against the other `.env` writers.
//!
//! Rejections are **named**, never silently dropped — an unknown service id or
//! a key outside the allow-list appears in the plan. A preset that quietly
//! ignores half of what it was given is how somebody concludes the feature
//! works and then spends an afternoon on the service it skipped.
