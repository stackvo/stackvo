//! Every suggestion this app makes to a user, in one place and translatable.
//!
//! ## The problem this closes
//!
//! `ErrorAlert.vue` shows a translated category heading over the specific
//! message, which is the right design and was already right. But underneath it
//! printed the `hint` **raw**, and every hint in the codebase was an English
//! literal written at the point it was raised — 57 of them, scattered across 25
//! modules. So a Turkish user saw a translated heading, an English explanation,
//! and an English suggestion.
//!
//! The suggestion is the worst one to leave untranslated. It is the sentence
//! that tells someone what to *do*: start Docker, choose a folder, adopt the
//! directory instead. A message they cannot read is a failure they cannot act
//! on.
//!
//! ## Why a catalogue rather than a key at each call site
//!
//! Passing a bare key — `.with_hint_key("startDocker")` — would have worked and
//! would have left the English text in 25 files and the key in 25 more places to
//! typo. A `Hint` is both halves at once, declared once, referenced by name:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! Err(Error::new(Code::EngineUnreachable, "...").with_hint(hints::START_DOCKER))
//! ```
//!
//! The call site reads better than the string it replaced, the compiler catches
//! a wrong name, and — the reason the readiness review wanted this — the whole
//! set is now **reviewable in one file** instead of being a grep across the
//! codebase.
//!
//! ## English is still carried
//!
//! Each `Hint` keeps its English text, and `Error::with_hint` still fills the
//! `hint` field with it. That is what the log records, what an MCP client sees,
//! and what the UI falls back to if a locale is missing the key. Translation is
//! an addition to the existing behaviour, never a replacement for it.
//!
//! `tests/hint_translations.rs` is what keeps that promise honest: it fails if a
//! hint here has no entry in `en.js`, or no entry in `tr.js`, or if a locale
//! carries a key nothing raises any more.
