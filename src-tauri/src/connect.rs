//! The string you paste into a database client.
//!
//! The services list already showed a container name, a port table and a
//! credentials block, and left the reader to assemble a URI from them. Nobody
//! assembles it wrong in an interesting way — they assemble it the *obvious*
//! way, which is with the container name in it, and then Compass says the host
//! cannot be resolved. `stackvo-mongo` is a name on the Docker network; a
//! client on the host has never heard of it.
//!
//! So this returns **two** addresses per service rather than one, because a
//! service genuinely has two and picking either as "the" connection string is
//! how the confusion started:
//!
//!   * from the host — `127.0.0.1` and the port Docker published, which is what
//!     Compass, TablePlus, `psql` and a `.env` on the developer's laptop want;
//!   * from another container — the container name and the port inside it,
//!     which is what a project's own application wants, and which does not go
//!     through a published port at all.
//!
//! ## Where the host port comes from
//!
//! From the engine when it can be asked, and only otherwise from `.env`. The
//! two disagree more often than they should: most templates publish
//! `{{ HOST_PORT_MONGO | default('27017') }}`, and `HOST_PORT_MONGO` is not one
//! of the keys `config.rs` embeds — so `.env` is silent and the port is a
//! literal inside a template. Reading the running container first means the
//! answer is the port a client can actually reach rather than the port the
//! configuration would produce if anyone had set it.
//!
//! A running container that publishes nothing reports no host address at all,
//! rather than one that would fail. That is a real state — a hand-edited
//! compose file, a port already taken — and inventing `127.0.0.1` for it would
//! be the same class of wrong answer this module exists to remove.
//!
//! ## The password
//!
//! Masked, on the same terms as [`crate::config::Env::service_credentials`]: a
//! URI with a live password in it is one screenshot away from being published,
//! and the whole point of `env_reveal` is that seeing a secret is an act. The
//! `reveal` argument is that act for this shape — one service, on a click.
//!
//! Percent-encoding happens here and not in the front end. A password
//! containing `@` or `/` produces a URI that parses as a different host, and
//! the failure is a connection error naming somewhere that does not exist.
