//! `stackvo` — the same core, from a terminal (A-1).
//!
//! Eight of the ten tools measured in `docs/durum.md` §2 ship a CLI. This one
//! sat unbuilt not because it was expensive but because it is a **third
//! surface**: the desktop reaches the core through `commands.rs`, the assistant
//! through `mcp.rs`, and a third consumer is a third thing that can drift away
//! from `contracts/ipc.json` while every test still passes. §5's second
//! question was whether to accept that, and the answer is the one `mcp.rs`
//! already demonstrated — accept it, and hold it the same way.
//!
//! ## How this is held to the contract
//!
//! Every entry in [`COMMANDS`] names the `contracts/ipc.json` command it
//! implements, and `tests/cli_surface.rs` cross-checks the pair: a command
//! naming something the contract does not declare fails the build, and so does
//! a command advertised as read-only whose contract command is a `mutation`.
//! That is exactly what `mcp.rs` does, for exactly the same reason — nothing
//! enforces any of it at compile time.
//!
//! One thing here is stronger than the MCP table. A tool there dispatches on
//! its *name*, so a table entry with no matching arm compiles and fails at call
//! time — the module says as much and leaves a fallback arm for it. Here the
//! table carries an [`Action`], dispatch matches on the enum, and the compiler
//! refuses a variant with no arm. There is no "listed but not implemented"
//! state to test for because there is no way to reach one.
//!
//! ## The two pieces that were missing
//!
//! `docs/durum.md` named them: an argument parser and a progress writer.
//!
//! **The parser** is [`parse`], and it is hand-rolled. `clap` is the obvious
//! answer and would be a dependency, which in this repository is a measured
//! decision rather than a reflex — the same call `agents::which` made against a
//! `which` crate. What is actually needed is long and short flags, `--flag=x`
//! and `--flag x`, and `--` to stop. What matters far more than the shape of
//! that code is that an unrecognised flag is an **error**: a CLI that ignores
//! `--tial 50` and quietly gives you the default has lied about what it did.
//!
//! **The progress writer** is [`Narrate`], the `ProgressSink` ADR 0005 left
//! room for. `Sink::App` posts to a window, `Null` drops, `Recording` keeps —
//! this one prints. It writes to **stderr**, and that split is the whole
//! discipline of this binary: stdout carries the answer, stderr carries the
//! narration, so `stackvo doctor --json | jq` works while a build is still
//! scrolling past.
//!
//! ## What it does not do
//!
//! It does not shell out to the desktop app, and it does not start one. Every
//! command here calls the same domain function the window calls, which is what
//! ADR 0001 bought: `&Path` and `&dyn ProgressSink` instead of `State` and
//! `AppHandle`. Nothing in this file names a Tauri type.
//!
//! Writes go through the same audit trail as the window's. A person who runs
//! `stackvo down` and a person who clicks the button leave the same record;
//! anything else would make the log a description of one surface rather than of
//! the machine.
//!
//! ## Exit codes
//!
//! Scripts branch on these, so they are part of the surface and are tested:
//!
//! | code | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | 0 | it worked |
//! | 1 | it failed |
//! | 2 | the command line was wrong |
//! | 3 | no workspace — nothing has been set up on this machine yet |
//! | 4 | the Docker engine is unreachable |
//!
//! 3 and 4 are separated from 1 because they are the two failures a wrapper
//! script wants to handle rather than report: one means "run the app once",
//! the other means "start Docker".
