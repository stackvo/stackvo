//! What has to be true before StackVo can do anything.
//!
//! The app is a front end for `docker compose` over a checkout of shell
//! scripts, and every one of those words is a prerequisite that can be missing
//! on a fresh machine. Until this existed the app opened regardless and each
//! button failed on its own terms: a compose plugin from 2019 produced
//! "unknown flag: --profile", a missing `stackvo-net` produced "network
//! declared as external, but could not be found", and on Windows the generator
//! failed with "program not found: bash". Three different errors, one cause
//! each, none of them stated up front.
//!
//! The set below is not invented here — it is what `core/cli/commands/install.sh`
//! checks before it will install, plus the two things only a desktop app needs
//! (a chosen checkout, and a shell to run the generator with).
