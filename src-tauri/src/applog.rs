//! The log files a project writes, as opposed to what its container prints.
//!
//! `container_logs_open` streams stdout and stderr from Docker, which is what
//! the entrypoint and the web server say. It is not where an application
//! records anything: a Laravel exception goes to `storage/logs/laravel.log`, an
//! nginx 502 goes to the mounted `error.log`, and a queue worker that died goes
//! to its own file under supervisord. None of those reach the container's
//! stdout, so none of them were visible anywhere in the app.
//!
//! Every one of these files is already on the host — the generated compose
//! mounts `projects/<name>` at `/var/www/html` and `logs/projects/<name>` at
//! `/var/log`. So this reads them directly rather than through `docker exec`:
//! no engine required, which matters because a container that crashed on boot
//! is exactly when its log is worth reading.
//!
//! Two roots, kept apart because they answer different questions:
//!
//!   * **application** — files the code wrote, under the project directory;
//!   * **server** — files the stack wrote, under `logs/projects/<name>`.
//!
//! Paths never cross the IPC boundary as paths. The UI is given an opaque id
//! (`app:storage/logs/laravel.log`) and hands it back; this module resolves it
//! against one of the two roots and refuses anything that lands outside. A
//! log viewer that accepts an absolute path from its own frontend is a file
//! reader for the whole disk.
