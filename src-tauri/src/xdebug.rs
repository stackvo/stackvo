//! Step debugging, as one switch.
//!
//! `xdebug` was already in `contracts/php-extensions.json` with per-version
//! pecl pins, so it could be compiled in by hand-editing `stackvo.json`. It
//! then still would not connect to anything, because installing the extension
//! is only the first of three things that have to be true:
//!
//! 1. **Compiled in.** `php.extensions` in the manifest, and a rebuild, because
//!    the generator writes `pecl install` into the Dockerfile.
//! 2. **Configured.** Xdebug 3 does nothing without `xdebug.mode=debug`, and it
//!    cannot reach an IDE without knowing which host to dial back to.
//! 3. **Live in the container that is actually running.**
//!
//! The three are reported separately because they come apart in practice, and a
//! single "on" that quietly means one of them would send people to their IDE
//! settings to look for a fault that is not there.
//!
//! ## Why an overlay file
//!
//! Steps 2 and 3 need an `environment:` block on the project's compose service,
//! and the PHP compose generator emits none — only `node.sh` has one. Adding it
//! is not available: the generator's output is under a byte-for-byte contract
//! with the Bash implementation (`generate_with` in `rust` mode refuses to write
//! when the two disagree), so a change on one side alone breaks the very check
//! that makes the port safe.
//!
//! Compose already solves this. The CLI layers three generated files with `-f`;
//! this writes a fourth that the generator neither produces nor knows about:
//!
//! ```yaml
//! services:
//!   shop:
//!     environment:
//!       XDEBUG_MODE: debug
//!       XDEBUG_CONFIG: "client_host=host.docker.internal client_port=9003 ..."
//! ```
//!
//! The overlay is a pure function of the manifests and is re-rendered on every
//! compose invocation rather than kept as state. That is not tidiness: an
//! overlay naming a project that has since been deleted defines a service with
//! no image and no build context, and compose then refuses **every** command,
//! including the `down` that would clear it. Deriving it fresh each time means
//! it cannot be stale, at the cost of reading a few small JSON files.
//!
//! ## The one thing this cannot fix
//!
//! `stackvo up` from the Bash CLI layers three files, not four. It will happily
//! recreate a container without the Xdebug environment, and debugging stops
//! working with nothing on screen to say why. `active` exists to make that
//! visible: it is read from the running container, never inferred.
