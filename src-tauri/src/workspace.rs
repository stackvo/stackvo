//! The two directories this app works in, and which of them anybody is asked
//! about.
//!
//! ## Why there are two
//!
//! There used to be one, and the app opened by asking for it. That question had
//! no good answer, because it was really two questions with different owners
//! stapled together.
//!
//! Everything under it except `projects/` belongs to the app: the compose files
//! it generates, the logs containers write, the certificates it issues, the
//! settings it saves, and the handful of templates somebody has overridden. A
//! user has no more opinion about where those live than they do about where
//! their browser keeps its cache, and being asked implies otherwise. Once the
//! templates moved into the binary there was not even a clone to point at —
//! the app was asking for a folder so it could create one.
//!
//! `projects/` is the opposite: it is the user's source code, it very often
//! already exists somewhere with a name of their choosing, and it is the one
//! thing they genuinely have to tell the app.
//!
//! So the app root is derived and created without asking, and the only question
//! left is the one worth asking.
//!
//! ## Why `~/.stackvo` and not the platform's app-data directory
//!
//! macOS convention says `~/Library/Application Support/…` and that is where
//! `preferences.json` lives. The stack cannot: those bind mounts reach Docker
//! through compose files, and not one of the twenty-odd `${HOST_STACKVO_ROOT}`
//! lines in the shipped templates is quoted. A path containing a space breaks
//! them twice over — YAML treats the value as unquoted scalar, and Compose
//! splits mount specs on `:` after the shell has already split on whitespace.
//! Quoting twenty-nine templates and remembering to quote the thirtieth is a
//! worse bet than a path with no spaces in it.
//!
//! `STACKVO_ROOT` still overrides it, which is what the tests and CI use.
