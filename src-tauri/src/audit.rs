//! A record of the things that cannot be taken back.
//!
//! `logging.rs` already writes a diagnostic log, and this is deliberately not
//! that. The two differ in every property that matters:
//!
//! | | diagnostic log | this |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | answers | "why did it fail?" | "what was done, and when?" |
//! | contents | operations, transitions, errors | privileged and irreversible acts only |
//! | rotation | daily, oldest of 7 deleted | **none** |
//! | audience | whoever is debugging | whoever has to account for the machine |
//!
//! The rotation row is the whole point, and it is why a second file exists
//! rather than a log level. A record that deletes itself after seven days
//! cannot answer "when was this host entry added", which is precisely the
//! question asked three weeks later. §13 of the readiness review asked for a
//! separate, unrotated trail; a filter over a rotating one would have been the
//! same file with a different name.
//!
//! ## What is in it, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! Only acts that change something outside this app and cannot be undone by
//! pressing the button again:
//!
//!   * a write to `/etc/hosts`, which needs elevation;
//!   * a change to certificate trust, which edits a system store;
//!   * deleting a project, which is `remove_dir_all` over somebody's source;
//!   * writing `.env`, which reconfigures every container in the stack;
//!   * restoring a database, which replaces data that was there;
//!   * loading an image bundle, which installs something from elsewhere.
//!   * moving a credential into the OS keystore, and taking it back out, which
//!     changes where a password lives and what can still read it.
//!   * importing a site from another tool, which copies somebody's source tree
//!     into the workspace and, when asked to move, removes the original;
//!   * registering the MCP server with an assistant, and unregistering it,
//!     which edits a file belonging to another application and — with
//!     `--allow-writes` — hands that assistant the ability to stop the stack.
//!
//! Starting a container is not here, and neither is reading anything. An audit
//! trail that records routine traffic is one nobody reads, and a trail nobody
//! reads is not evidence — it is a file. The bar is "would somebody have to
//! account for this?", not "did something happen?".
//!
//! ## No identity field, and that is honest rather than lazy
//!
//! This is a single-user desktop app running as the person at the keyboard. An
//! `actor` column would be the OS account repeated on every line, which reads
//! as an authorisation record and is not one — the app has no accounts, no
//! roles and nothing to authenticate against. The account that owns the file is
//! the answer, and the file lives in that account's own directory.
//!
//! ## Failures are recorded too
//!
//! An attempt that was refused is exactly as interesting as one that worked —
//! more so, in the cases anyone reviews these for. `outcome` carries which.
