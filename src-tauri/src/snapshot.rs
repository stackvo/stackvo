//! Named database snapshots, and the schedule that takes them unattended.
//!
//! `db.rs` could already dump a database to a path the user chose in a save
//! dialog, and that is raw material rather than a feature: a file called
//! `mysql-2026-08-11T09-14-02.sql` in Downloads is not something anybody comes
//! back to. `ddev snapshot` and `lerd db:snapshot` name a point in time and
//! restore it by that name; Laragon and ServBay take one on a timer. Both
//! halves are gaps G-1 and G-2 of the competitive review, and both are this
//! module.
//!
//! ## The registry is the directory
//!
//! There is no index file. A snapshot is a file under
//! `<root>/backups/<service>/`, its name is the file's stem, and when it was
//! taken is the file's modification time. An index would be a second answer to
//! "what snapshots exist" that drifts the first time somebody deletes a file in
//! Finder — and the recovery from that drift is worse than the feature: a
//! restore that names a file which is not there.
//!
//! ## Retention never deletes a snapshot a person named
//!
//! The one rule worth stating twice. A schedule with a retention window keeps
//! N and removes the rest, and that is right for the copies it took itself.
//! Applying it to `before-the-migration` — typed by somebody at the moment they
//! were most worried — would be the worst failure this feature could have. So
//! automatic snapshots are named with a prefix ([`AUTO_PREFIX`]), and
//! [`prune`] only ever looks at those.
//!
//! ## What a schedule is, and what it is not
//!
//! It is an interval and a retention count, checked by a background loop that
//! asks "when was the last automatic snapshot" and compares it with the clock.
//! It is deliberately **not** a cron expression: this is a laptop, it sleeps,
//! and a missed 03:00 is a backup that never happened. An interval measured
//! from the last successful snapshot survives a closed lid.
