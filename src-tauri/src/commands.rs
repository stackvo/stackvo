/// corrected by reading. A running container that publishes nothing has no host
/// address at all, and this says so rather than inventing `127.0.0.1`.
///

///
/// It has to be — a URI with bullets in it is a URI that fails to connect, and
/// the point of the button is that nothing is retyped. So this is `reveal` in
/// the sense of `env_reveal` and `service_connection`: an act, on a click, for
/// one service, and it is recorded like one.
///
/// What it costs is that the secret is an argument to `open`, so it is visible
/// in `ps` for as long as that process lives. That is a real exposure and it is
/// written down rather than left for someone to find: the alternative is a
/// temporary file holding the same secret with the same reachability and a
/// lifetime nobody controls, which is worse. On a single-user machine holding
/// development credentials it is the right trade; on a shared one it is a
