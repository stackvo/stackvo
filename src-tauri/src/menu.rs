//! Tauri builds a sensible default — the app menu, Edit with the clipboard
//! shortcuts, Window, Help — and that default is kept rather than replaced.
//! Replacing it means re-declaring every standard item by hand, and the first
//! one forgotten is the one nobody tests: `Cmd+V` stops working in a text
//! field and nothing in the app looks broken.
//!
//! So this only *adds*. `Menu::default` gives the Help submenu a stable id, so
//! the item can be appended to it without matching on a title the platform may
//! have translated.
