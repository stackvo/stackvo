//! Assembling `docker-compose.dynamic.yml` from the instance table.
//!
//! The last piece of Faz 2 in `docs/servis-market-mimarisi.md`. What
//! `template::render_dynamic_compose` does today is walk a fixed array of
//! twenty-five compiled-in templates and include the ones whose
//! `SERVICE_<ID>_ENABLE` says `true`. This does the same job from the other
//! end: it walks [`instances::Table`] and renders each instance's package
//! fragment.
//!
//! ADR 0002 is untouched and is the reason this is safe to swap: the file has
//! always been rendered from scratch on every run and never edited in place, so
//! changing what it is rendered *from* changes no invariant anybody depends on.
//!
//! ## The render context is the whole of what a fragment can see
//!
//! A fragment gets `image`, `instance.*`, `port.*`, `volume.*`, `file.*`,
//! `settings.*` and `network` — nothing else, and every one of them is built
//! here from the instance and its manifest. That is a security boundary rather
//! than a convenience: `template::render` substitutes any name matching its
//! prefix list, so a downloaded fragment handed the workspace's variables could
//! write somebody's `SERVICE_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` into an `environment:` line
//! of its own and out to wherever it liked.
//!
//! ## Every fragment passes the policy before it is assembled
//!
//! [`compose_policy::check`] runs on each rendered block, and it runs *here*
//! rather than only in the packages repository's CI because those two ask
//! different questions. That one asks "should we ship this"; this one asks
//! "should this machine run it", and only the second is still standing when a
//! repository has been taken over or a mirror is lying.
//!
//! It runs after substitution on purpose — see that module — which is why this
//! one hands it the exact set of mount sources it produced. After rendering
//! there are no handles left to compare against.
