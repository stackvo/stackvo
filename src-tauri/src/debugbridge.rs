//! Catching debug signals out of a running container, without restarting it.
//!
//! ## What was wrong with the version this replaces
//!
//! [`crate::dumps`] points Symfony's `VarDumper` at Symfony's own
//! `var-dump-server`, started with `docker exec` inside the project container.
//! It works, and three things about it cannot be fixed from where it stands:
//!
//! 1. **Turning it on costs a container.** The two variables arrive through a
//!    compose overlay, and a container's environment is fixed when it is
//!    created — so "start catching dumps" means recreating the container and
//!    waiting for the stack. Herd and Lerd both toggle theirs live; Lerd sells
//!    that explicitly ("no FPM container restart, no worker cascade").
//! 2. **It only sees `dump()`.** Queries, jobs, rendered views and outgoing
//!    HTTP calls are the signals people actually spend the day on, and none of
//!    them reaches `VarDumper`.
//! 3. **The output is text.** Symfony's CLI renderer produces a formatted
//!    block; the app streams it into a `<pre>`. Nothing can be searched,
//!    grouped by request, or linked back to the line that produced it, because
//!    by the time it arrives it is no longer data.
//!
//! ## The mechanism
//!
//! A PHP file, mounted into the container and loaded through
//! `auto_prepend_file`, plus a sentinel file the host creates and removes.
//!
//! `auto_prepend_file` runs **before the application's autoloader**, and that
//! is what makes this work at all: Symfony guards its own helpers with
//! `function_exists('dump')`, so whichever definition arrives first wins, and
//! the prepend file is always first. Lerd's bridge does the same thing for the
//! same reason. Nothing is hooked, patched or observed — the functions are
//! simply declared.
//!
//! It follows that the bridge must declare them **only while capture is on**.
//! With the sentinel absent it declares nothing and returns after a single
//! `is_file`, so Symfony's own `dump()` loads and behaves exactly as it does
//! without this app. That is also why toggling is free: the next request reads
//! the flag again, and a flag is a file in a directory that is already mounted.
//!
//! ## Why a file and not a socket
//!
//! The obvious design is a receiver on the host and a socket from the
//! container, which is what both competitors do — and what the Xdebug overlay
//! already proves is reachable, since it dials `host.docker.internal`. It was
//! rejected on two counts. A host-side listener has to bind somewhere, and the
//! only address every platform agrees a container can reach is not loopback —
//! a dump stream carries request bodies and query bindings, and putting that on
//! a listening port is a bigger decision than the feature is worth. And the
//! events have to survive a page reload to be worth grouping, which means
//! writing them down somewhere regardless.
//!
//! So the bridge appends newline-delimited JSON to a file in a writable mount,
//! and the app tails it. No port, no `host.docker.internal`, no difference
//! between platforms, and "keep the last N events across restarts" — a paid
//! feature elsewhere — is what the design already does.
//!
//! ## Verified in a container, not reasoned about
//!
//! Every claim above was run against `php 8.4` in one of this checkout's own
//! project containers before the module was finished:
//!
//! * with the sentinel absent the bridge declares nothing, so `dump()` is
//!   still Symfony's;
//! * with it present, `dump()` captures and returns its argument, and `dd()`
//!   captures and exits 1;
//! * the emitted line parses as the [`Event`] below, with file, line, request
//!   and SAPI filled in.
//!
//! One thing that only shows up by running it: **`php -r` does not process
//! `auto_prepend_file` at all.** `ini_get` reports the setting and the file is
//! never loaded. It costs nothing here — web requests, `artisan` and queue
//! workers all execute a script — but a `-r` one-liner is not a way to test
//! this, and half an hour went into finding that out.
