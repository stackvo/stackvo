//! The workspace skeleton, compiled into the binary.
//!
//! Until Sprint 23 the app could only manage a directory somebody had already
//! cloned: `looks_like_stackvo` demanded `core/templates` and `projects/`, so
//! the first thing a new user had to do was find and clone another repository.
//! The generator moved here in Sprint 17 and the Bash CLI was deleted in
//! Sprint 19; the templates it renders were the last input still living
//! somewhere else.
//!
//! They now ship inside the executable. A workspace stops being something the
//! user brings and becomes something the app can *create* — an empty folder is
//! a valid answer to "where should StackVo live".
//!
//! ## Why compiled in rather than bundled beside the app
//!
//! `bundle.resources` would copy the files next to the executable and need
//! `resolve_resource()` to find them, which resolves differently under
//! `tauri dev` than in a packaged app — a class of bug that only appears after
//! packaging, which is the worst time to find it. `include_dir!` has no path
//! to get wrong: the bytes are in the binary.
//!
//! ## What is NOT here
//!
//! `projects/`, `generated/` and `logs/` are created empty. They are the
//! user's code, this app's output, and the containers' output respectively —
//! none of them is a template, and shipping any of them would mean shipping
//! somebody else's data.
//!
//! ## Why nothing is copied to disk until somebody asks
//!
//! Installing used to write all thirty files into `core/`, and never overwrite
//! them again — the right rule for a file somebody has edited, applied to files
//! nobody had. Three things followed from that.
//!
//! A disk copy stopped meaning anything. `read_template` reads the workspace
//! first precisely so an edit wins, so "there is a file at `core/templates/…`"
//! is supposed to mean "the user changed this". Writing it for everyone made it
//! mean "the workspace was installed", which is not a question anyone asks.
//!
//! Template fixes could not ship. Improve the redis template, release, and
//! every existing workspace keeps the old bytes for good — with no way to tell
//! a stale pristine copy from a deliberate edit, so nothing could safely
//! rewrite it either.
//!
//! And the useful list — *which templates has this workspace changed* — was not
//! computable. It is now: [`overridden`] is the answer, and it is exactly the
//! set of files on disk.
//!
//! So `install` creates directories, and a file appears under `core/` only when
//! [`materialize`] puts it there because somebody chose to override it.
//! [`revert`] deletes it and the embedded copy takes over again.
