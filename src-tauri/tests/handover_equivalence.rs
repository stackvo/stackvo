//! What a migrated workspace gets, against what it has today.
//!
//! This is the check `docs/servis-market-mimarisi.md` §7 calls the handover's
//! only real safety, and it is worth saying exactly what it can and cannot be.
//!
//! It **cannot** be a byte comparison. The whole point of the new pipeline is
//! that names change: `stackvo-mysql` becomes `stackvo-mysql-8-0`, and a
//! service key becomes an instance id. A test demanding identical output would
//! be a test demanding the feature not work.
//!
//! So it compares the things that are supposed to be *unchanged*, field by
//! field: the image somebody's container runs, the port their tooling connects
//! to, the volume their rows are in, the environment the engine boots with.
//! Those four are what a migration must not touch, and each of them has a
//! specific way of going wrong — a re-pulled image, a moved port, an adopted
//! volume that was not adopted, a password that came from the wrong place.
//!
//! ## The fixture, and what it does not cover
//!
//! Four packages, copied from `stackvo-service-packages` and pinned here:
//! mysql (a config file, a named volume, a secret), redis (a config file and no
//! settings at all), phpmyadmin (a Traefik router and no volume), and kafka (a
//! companion container). Between them they reach every branch of the renderer.
//!
//! They are **not** the whole catalogue. Twenty-one services are not exercised
//! here, and saying so is the point of this paragraph: the packages repository
//! runs `validate.mjs` and `compose-check.mjs` over all hundred and one, and
//! this file is about the *shape of the migration*, not about coverage.
