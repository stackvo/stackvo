//! The loopback surface, over a real socket.
//!
//! `websurface.rs`'s own tests cover the pure halves — parsing, routing, the
//! token comparison — and every one of them hands a `Request` to a function.
//! That is the right shape for the logic and it proves nothing about the
//! listener: whether it binds where it says, whether it reads a body to the end
//! rather than until the peer gives up, whether a caller with no token gets the
//! same answer for a path that exists and one that does not.
//!
//! Those are the questions a socket answers. `elevate_probe.rs` makes the same
//! argument for `pkexec` and states it better: a coder testing against their own
//! expectation only agrees with themselves.
//!
//! ## No client library
//!
//! The requests below are written as bytes over `TcpStream`. ADR 0019's method
//! and `tests/driver/webdriver.js`'s: the thing being tested is what goes on the
//! wire, and a client that normalises a malformed request before sending it
//! would hide exactly the case worth checking.
//!
//! ## Why `multi_thread`
//!
//! `#[tokio::test]` gives a current-thread runtime, and every request below is
//! written with blocking `std::net` calls on the test thread. On one thread the
//! accept loop never gets polled while the test is inside `read_to_string`, so
//! the first version of this file deadlocked until the read timeout and
//! reported the server as silent. The server was fine; the test was holding the
//! only thread it had.
