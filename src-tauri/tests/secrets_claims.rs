//! The four rules the keystore layer would be dangerous without.
//!
//! Every one of them is invisible on the machine somebody would break it on: a
//! developer with an unlocked keychain and no `stackvo.sh` in their workflow
//! sees a feature that works, whichever way these are written.
//!
//!   1. `apply_verbatim` has **one** caller. A second one puts a password back
//!      in `.env` on somebody pressing Save.
//!   2. The ordinary write path consults the current line, so a moved key stays
//!      moved.
//!   3. The generator refuses on an unresolved reference, rather than rendering
//!      the template default and starting a database on a password nobody chose.
//!   4. The documentation keeps saying the value is still in `generated/`.
//!      A keystore feature is read as "the secret is off the disk"; this one is
//!      not, and the sentence saying so is the difference between a partial win
//!      and a false one.
