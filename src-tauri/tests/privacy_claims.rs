//! Every host this app can reach is named in `PRIVACY.md`.
//!
//! The readiness review's §4.3 asked for a decision rather than a silence: a
//! tool that collects nothing and a tool that collects something look identical
//! from the outside, so "there is no telemetry" is not a property of a build —
//! it is a claim about one. `PRIVACY.md` makes the claim. This file is what
//! stops it from quietly stopping being true.
//!
//! The failure it exists for is not a developer deciding to add analytics. It
//! is the ordinary one: a feature needs to fetch something, a URL goes into a
//! module, and the document that says "the only thing it contacts is the update
//! endpoint" is now wrong and nothing anywhere disagrees with it. `README.md`
//! had exactly this class of defect for months and it took a measurement to
//! find (`readme_claims.rs`); a privacy statement is a worse place for it,
//! because the reader has no way of checking.
//!
//! ## What is scanned
//!
//! * `src-tauri/src/*.rs`, production regions only — a `https://example.com` in
//!   a test is a fixture, not a destination.
//! * `src/**/*.{js,vue}`, excluding specs — the front end opens links in the
//!   user's browser, which leaves the machine just as surely.
//! * `tauri.conf.json`'s updater endpoints, which are a destination compiled
//!   into the build and appear in no source file at all.
//!
//! ## What is not a destination
//!
//! Four rules, each stated rather than a list of exceptions that grows every
//! time the gate is inconvenient. A blocklist of hosts to ignore is how a gate
//! stops meaning anything: the tenth entry is added without a thought, and the
//! tenth entry is the one that mattered.
