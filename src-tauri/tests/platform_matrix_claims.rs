//! The measurement table in `docs/durum.md`, held to the same standard as
//! `README.md`.
//!
//! That table answers with counts — how many commands there are, how many
//! front-end files reach for Tauri, how many places the data path goes through.
//! Counts taken once and then left behind are how a document came to say 142
//! commands against 149, 47 front-end files against 95, and 32,515 lines of
//! Rust against 37,969.
//!
//! Nothing was wrong when it was written. That is the point: a number in prose
//! has no way of aging, so it stops being a measurement and becomes a memory of
//! one, and the reader cannot tell which they are looking at.
//!
//! `readme_claims.rs` makes this argument for `README.md` and
//! `architecture_claims.rs` for `ARCHITECTURE.md`. This is the same gate for
//! the status document, which absorbed the platform matrix's numbers when the
//! five documents under `docs/` became one.
//!
//! ## What is checked, and what deliberately is not
//!
//! Checked: the counts a parser can settle — commands, files, wrappers, lines,
//! and the four commands the document names as having no web meaning.
//!
//! Not checked: the four classification counts the document itself marks as
//! manual and prints the method for. Those are judgements about what code
//! *means*, and a test that pretended to settle them would be a worse lie than
//! the stale number this file exists to prevent.
